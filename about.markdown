TMy name is Scott Wright. I live in Marietta, Georgia. I am Married and have two children. My wife and I run a small
business called Salon Suites where we rent furnished suites to hair stylists and other beauty industry professionals
where they can run their own business.

I have been developing software and managing and tuning databases for 40 years, sometimes as a side job, sometimes
as full time job, and currently in pursuit of a SAAS product I hope to one day bring to market.
