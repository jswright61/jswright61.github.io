I put down a reservation fee for my Tesla Model 3 on the day they opened up reservations. I was excited when I got to
place my order almost 2 years later, and thrilled when I took delivery of my bright blue, rear wheel drive, long range
Tesla model 3 just over 4 years ago. My car is better today than when I drove it off the lot. I have never said that
about a car before, and I think very few people can say that about any car that they did not put significant work in to
customizing or restoring. I have put no time or money into making my Tesla better (save some minor accessories). What
has made my car better have been the consistent improvements delivered by Tesla to the firmware through which I interact
with my car.

I think of Tesla doing for automobiles what Apple did for cell phones. It was extremely rare, before the iPhone, for
phones to get firmaware updates. When they did, it was mostly for critical security fixes, added functionallity was just
not a thing. Even the security fixes would only be available for fairly recent models. Have an 18 month old phone - your
upgrade path was to buy a new phone (in 6 months when your carrier would let you). The iPhone changed that. Tesla
delivers firmware upgrades regularly, my guestimate is about every 6 to 8 weeks on average. And they are still coming,
for my 4 year old car,

There have been many improvements to the user interface in the 4 years I've owned my car. Sometimes the UI regresses a
bit, but a huge percentage of the changes (95%+) have been in the right direction, and those that missed the mark have
been refined and improved. The result is a better car and  a better driving experience.

There are still some things that need to refined
