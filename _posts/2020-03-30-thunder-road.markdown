I learned about Laura on Twitter. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic she had both time and a need for some extra $ as she found herself unemployed. She decided to take requests to perform songs on piano and viola. She gratefully accepts donations. You can make a request and see how to donate if you want here. I made a request for Thunder Road and was thrilled with the rendition she and her accompanist performed.
