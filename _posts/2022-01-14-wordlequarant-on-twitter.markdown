[@WordleQuarant](https://twitter.com/wordlequarant) is a Twitter account created by [Dieter Bohn](https://twitter.com/backlon)
to do 1 simple thing: Allow people to post their [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) results to their
followers, but **only** followers who have self selected as interested in Wordle results.

How do they self select? They self select by following [@WordleQuarant](https://twitter.com/wordlequarant) on Twitter.

How does one make sure only these
self selected followers see their Wordle results? Start a new Tweet with the very first characters "@WordleQuarant ",
no dots or spaces before the @, the space after coulld be a return or just a space, and then paste the copied Worsle results. Here is a recent example:

Why does this work? It goes back to the early days of Twitter. Tweets that start with an @mention, by default, are seen
only by the mentioned party and those that follow both the author and the mentioned party. The tweets are public and
visible in the author's list of Tweets and in the mentioned party's mentions, but others will not see them in their
own default timeline unless they follow both accounts. This is why you see so many Tweets that begin with a period
followed by an @mention (.@jswright61). This is an early convention whereby someone could direct a Tweet at a specific
account and making it default visible to all of the author's followers as well.
